#House Sales in King County, USA

This repository contains the assignment solution for the Data Analysis with Python course on Coursera, offered by IBM. The analysis is centered around housing sales data from King County, USA, providing insights and predictions using Python-based tools and techniques.

**üìä Project Overview**
The dataset includes details of house sales in King County, USA, such as prices, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other related features. The goal is to explore, analyze, and derive meaningful insights while applying statistical and machine learning methods.

**Objectives**
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
* Identify correlations between features and house prices.
* Use visualizations to uncover trends and outliers.
* Predict house prices using regression models.
* Draw actionable conclusions from the findings.

**üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries**

The analysis was performed using the following:

* Python: Primary programming language for data analysis.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
* NumPy: For numerical computations.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
* Scikit-learn: For building regression models.

**üìÇ File Structure**
IBM Data Analysis with Python.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the entire analysis and predictions.

Dataset: The housing sales dataset provided in the assignment.

**üîç Key Insights**

Correlation Analysis:

Features such as sqft_living, grade, and sqft_above showed a strong positive correlation with house prices, while others like yr_built had weaker relationships.

**Outliers:**
Identified and visualized price outliers, particularly in properties with waterfront views.

*Regression Models:**

Linear regression was used to predict house prices, achieving significant accuracy by focusing on the most impactful features.

**üåü Highlights**
* The project combines EDA, feature selection, and predictive modeling to provide a comprehensive understanding of the housing market in King County.
* Visualizations were instrumental in identifying patterns and presenting insights effectively.
* A hands-on approach to building regression models improved practical data analysis and prediction skills.
